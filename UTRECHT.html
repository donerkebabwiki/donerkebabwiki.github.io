      <p>“Lovely owners, who welcomed me like I was a dear friend. Asked me if I had had döner before, told me about their homemade sauce, and were very keen to know if I would like their style of döner. Well, it was delicious. Made to order, and obviously made with love. They just happened to be on our way home, but this place was a lucky find. Of all the döner shops to get your cheat-meal, this is one I would come back to.”</p>
